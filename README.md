# Composing Callbacks Workshop

## Purpose
Write small, composable functions to improve code readability
and reusability in complex asynchronous scenarios.

## Goals
1. Indentify Broadcasters and Listeners
2. Decouple Broadcasters and Listeners to insert Operators
3. Understand how Operators relay values from Broadcasters to Listeners
4. Write your own Operators
5. Compose Operators as complexity grows
6. Stop Broadcasters when you're done with their values

>> Note: Instead of "starting over" if a user makes a misake,
>> you'll want to .push the new value and .shift the oldest value on the array 
>> that keeps track of the values
>> so you're always checking against the past 4 values

## ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Troubleshooting

### Async/Await
If you get a "regenerator runtime" error, make sure to add the following to your `package.json`:
```json
"browserslist": [
    "last 1 Chrome versions"
]
```

### Weird Reloading Issues
If you experience reloading issues on Codesandbox,
open their settings and enable "Hard Reload on Change".

This disables the "hot module reloading" which tries to
keep state between reloads.
